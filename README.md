Learning-By-Doing is a concept by which productivity is achieved through practice, self-perfection and minor innovations. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning-by-doing_(economics)]

This is my attempt to learn machine learning by following th book "Python Machine Learning" by Sebastian Raschka [https://www.amazon.com/Python-Machine-Learning-Sebastian-Raschka/dp/1783555130/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1470882464&sr=8-1&keywords=python+machine+learning].

It is awesome book, and recommend you buying this book.
